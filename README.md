# SpaceGame
### A game similar to Space Invaders made in 24 hours.
Initially I had to implement a game with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) as a school assignment,
but it turned out to be a fun little project, so I put more effort in it than planned.
This however doesn't mean the code is good (it's actually pretty ugly and hacky), as I still wanted to finish it in a reasonable amount
of time.

You play as a red spaceship with dual-lasers doing its best to defend its base against aliens,
the red hearts represent your remaining lives and the yellow ones those of your base. Your goal is to destroy the enemy spaceships before they
reach your home and attack it. If either your lives or the lives of your base fall to zero the game is over.

All the sprites were drawn by me using [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/). I discovered this site while looking for an easy-to-use
online-editor for pixelart, and I am impressed by how good of a tool it is (especially because it's for free).
The font for the score was downloaded [here](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/monobit-font/), so credit where credit is due.
